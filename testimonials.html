        <li class="item"><a href="#testimonial"></a>JOHN >> <span> its Training and placement cell helped me and many
                students like me to get placed it in the first phase of placements. We all were excited in the ending of
                6th semester and the reason was placement training which was supposed to be started in the semester
                holidays, Training was started with Aptitude classes by Quantech Origin where clear importance was given
                to the approach to solve any type of questions and also questions according to the company’s pattern and
                even focus was given on various HR questions and the trainer’s also shared their past interview
                experiences. After 1 week of aptitude training then started soft skill training by Zane sir which really
                helped me to overcome my stage fear and make me more confident. The training which I received by our
                college helped me to get through a company in my very first attempt, I am really thankful to our
                college, my lecturers and also placement director Mr. Shaikh Moonirul Haque for their continuous support
                and encouragement</span></li>

        <li class="item"><a href="#testimonial"></a>RONALDO >> <span>Hi everyone. I would like to share the secret/logic
                behind the placement which led me to be a part of a core company. Some of them are listed below.
                Placement training activity led by a superior team, which was conducted in our college helped each and
                every student more effectively. Don’t feel exhausted if you are not placed initially, if the company is
                filtering you it means that you getting ready for the best. So attend all the drives with interest

                Most importantly our Placement Officer (Shaikh sir) gave enough opportunities for each and everyone and
                motivated us in every process he is one of the best guide I have ever seen</span></li>

        <li class="item"><a href="#testimonial"></a>ANGELA >> <span>Starting to our placement training with Quantech
                origin for our aptitude definitely helped me a lot in getting touch with all the shortcuts for aptitude
                that was left behind in my second year and ending it with Zane's training for soft skill was a memorable
                one that included fun as well as learning. I being a person who lacks confidence was helped to overcome
                it to great extents because of the soft skill training provided that helped me get through my final HR
                round for Infosys campus recruitment process. I would like to Thank our Placement Officer, Mr. Shaikh
                Moonirul Haque for all the support he gave when required</span></li>

        <li class="item"><a href="#testimonial"></a>TOM >> <span>"It is true that students are the brand ambassadors of
                college". It does not matter to which college you belong to, it's the matter of quality of education and
                getting into the corporate world by utilizing them. It was my great journey in AMCEC in the department
                of ISE. There were many seminars, placement training activities that helped us to boost ourselves and
                increased our confidence level. Our Placement Officer Mr. Shaikh Moonirul Haque a friendly person who
                addresses students in all his busy schedule helped us to know about the interview process prior to the
                actual drives by conducting placement training in pre final year on soft skills and quant which helped
                us to crack the interview. I would like to thank our Principal, HOD of ISE and all out faculty for what
                I am today.</span></li>
